/**
 * TypeScript Import Resolution (Cascading from Root to Server)
 *
 * This project uses a cascading import structure, where TypeScript modules are organized and imported
 * in a hierarchical fashion. The import resolution flows from the root of the project, through shared
 * packages, to individual applications, and finally to the server layer.
 *
 * - **Root Level:** The root directory typically contains configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`)
 *   and may define base path aliases or global types. These configurations are inherited by sub-packages and apps.
 *
 * - **Packages:** Shared code, utilities, and libraries are placed in the `packages` directory. These packages are
 *   imported by both apps and the server, promoting code reuse and modularity. Imports from packages often use
 *   path aliases defined in the root `tsconfig.json`.
 *
 * - **Apps:** Application-specific code resides in the `apps` directory. Apps import shared logic from packages,
 *   as well as their own internal modules. This layer is responsible for the main business logic and user-facing features.
 *
 * - **Server:** The server layer (often in `apps/server` or a similar directory) imports both app-specific code and
 *   shared packages. It acts as the entry point for backend execution, orchestrating requests and responses.
 *
 * **Import Example:**
 * ```ts
 * // Importing a shared utility from packages
 * import { sharedUtil } from '@myorg/shared-utils';
 *
 * // Importing an app-specific module
 * import { feature } from './features/featureA';
 * ```
 *
 * **Key Points:**
 * - Path aliases (e.g., `@myorg/*`) are configured in the root `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports.
 * - Imports cascade down: root → packages → apps → server.
 * - This structure ensures maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.
