### 🌟 High-Level Summary

This release introduces a robust, type-safe Express server in the `platform-server` package. The server is built with TypeScript, supports environment configuration via `.env`, and uses a shared root `tsconfig.base.json` for consistent type safety. Development is streamlined with Nodemon and ts-node for live reloads. The only endpoint exposed is `/test` for initial validation. Scripts for development, build, and production are included, and all dependencies are properly isolated to their respective packages.

### 📦 Changes by Package

#### `platform-server`
- **Added**
  - New TypeScript-based Express server with a `/test` endpoint in `src/server.ts`.
  - `.env.example` for environment variable configuration (supports `PORT`).
  - `tsconfig.json` extending from root `tsconfig.base.json`.
  - Scripts for `dev` (Nodemon + ts-node), `build` (tsc), and `start` (node dist/server.js).
  - Local dependencies: `express`, `dotenv`, and their types.
  - Minimal `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
- **Changed**
  - Ensured all Express and dotenv dependencies are local to `platform-server` only.

#### `platform-core`
- **Changed**
  - Removed `@types/express` from devDependencies to avoid unnecessary coupling with Express.

### 🗂 Affected Workspaces and files

- `platform-server`
- `packages/platform-core`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- `tsconfig.base.json`

---

### ⚙️ Developer Setup

- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to update workspace links
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `platform-server`
- [ ] Use `pnpm --filter platform-server run dev` to start the server in development mode

---

### 🧪 Validation Steps

- Manual test: confirmed `/test` endpoint returns `Test OK` (200)
- Ran `pnpm --filter platform-server run build` to verify no TypeScript errors
- Confirmed only local dependencies for Express in `platform-server`

---

### 🔮 Follow-ups

- [ ] Integrate additional endpoints and business logic as needed
- [ ] Add database integration in future updates
- [ ] Create dev/start scripts per app/server as the platform grows
