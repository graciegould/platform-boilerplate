## üåü User Story

> As a developer,  
> I want a robust, type-safe Express server running in the `platform-server` package with a dedicated `server.ts` entrypoint and environment variable support,  
> So that the backend is easy to develop, restart automatically with Nodemon, use shared TypeScript configuration, and allow local customization via environment variables.

## üöÄ Summary for AI & Human Reviewers

This PR scaffolds a new TypeScript-based Express server in the `platform-server` package. It introduces a `/test` endpoint, uses a shared root `tsconfig.base.json`, supports `.env` configuration, and provides scripts for development, build, and production. All Express and dotenv dependencies are local to `platform-server`, and unnecessary Express types are removed from `platform-core`. This setup streamlines backend development and ensures type safety and environment flexibility.

## üß™ Automated & Manual Test Plan

**Automated Tests:**
*   **Command**: `pnpm --filter platform-server run build`
*   **Expected Outcome**: No TypeScript errors.

**Manual Validation Steps:**
1.  **Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `platform-server`.
2.  **Action**: Run `pnpm --filter platform-server run dev`.
3.  **Observation**: Console logs `[platform-server] listening on port 3000` (or the value set in `.env`).
4.  **Action**: Visit `http://localhost:3000/test`.
5.  **Observation**: Response status is 200 with body `Test OK`.

## üìù Implementation Notes for the Reviewer

- All Express and dotenv dependencies are now local to `platform-server`.
- `platform-core` no longer includes any Express types.
- The server is intentionally minimal, exposing only `/test` for validation.
- The setup is ready for further backend development and extension.
