### ðŸŒŸ High-Level Summary

This Scaffold Monorepo establishes the foundational PNPM-based monorepo structure. It includes seven workspace packages with a clearly defined dependency hierarchy, enabling shared logic and types across applications and services. This sets the stage for scalable development and future integration with CI/CD and task runners.
