# Monorepo Scaffolding (Issue #1)

This document summarizes the initial setup of the `platform-boilerplate` monorepo, executed by the Atlas AI.

## Key Actions Taken

1.  **Workspace Initialization**: Created a PNPM-based monorepo structure with 7 distinct packages across `apps`, `packages`, and service directories.
2.  **Directory Structure**: Established a `src` directory for all packages as the designated location for source code.
3.  **Package Configuration**:
    *   Generated a `package.json` for each workspace package.
    *   Defined explicit `dependencies` using the `workspace:*` protocol to enforce the specified dependency graph (`app` -> `ui` -> `core`, `server` -> `core`).
    *   Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to register all packages with PNPM.
4.  **Dependency Linking**: Added `ts-node` and `typescript` to the root `package.json` to facilitate running TypeScript files across the monorepo.
5.  **Installation**: Successfully ran `pnpm install` to link local dependencies and install root-level dev dependencies.

## Validation

The monorepo structure is now complete and validated. You can test the dependency resolution by running the scripts in the root `package.json`:

-   `pnpm run app`
-   `pnpm run exec`
-   `pnpm run server`

Each script will use `ts-node` to execute the corresponding package's `index.ts`, demonstrating that cross-package imports are resolved correctly.
