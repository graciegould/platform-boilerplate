## üåü User Story

> As a full-stack platform engineer,  
> I want to scaffold the foundational structure of all workspace packages with valid `package.json` files, source directories, and clearly declared interdependencies,  
> So that I can enable proper workspace linking via pnpm, enforce clear dependency flow, and prepare for integration with Turborepo.

## üöÄ Summary for AI & Human Reviewers

This pull request establishes the foundational monorepo structure for the entire platform. It creates seven distinct packages under PNPM workspaces, defines the dependency graph between them (`app` -> `ui` -> `core`), and installs the necessary tooling (`typescript`, `ts-node`) to validate the setup. The result is a clean, linkable, and scalable monorepo, ready for feature development.

## üß± Architectural Impact

**Modified Packages:**
- `[x] platform-core`
- `[x] platform-ui`
- `[x] platform-app`
- `[x] platform-exec`
- `[x] platform-server`
- `[x] platform-dev`
- `[x] platform-db`

**Dependency Changes (per package):**
*   **`platform-ui`**:
    *   Added: `platform-core@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-app`**:
    *   Added: `platform-ui@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-exec`**:
    *   Added: `platform-ui@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-server`**:
    *   Added: `platform-core@workspace:*`
*   **`(root) package.json`**:
    *   Added: `ts-node@10.9.2`
    *   Added: `typescript@5.4.5`

## üß™ Automated & Manual Test Plan

**Automated Tests:**
*   **Command**: `N/A`
*   **Expected Outcome**: No automated tests were added in this foundational PR.

**Manual Validation Steps:**
1.  **Setup**: Run `pnpm install` in the root directory.
2.  **Observation**: The installation should complete successfully with no workspace linking errors.
3.  **Action**: Run `pnpm run app`.
4.  **Observation**: The console should log messages from `platform-app`, `platform-ui`, and `platform-core`, demonstrating the import chain is working correctly.
5.  **Action**: Run `pnpm run server`.
6.  **Observation**: The console should log messages from `platform-server` and `platform-core`.

## üìù Implementation Notes for the Reviewer

- This PR establishes the core architecture. All subsequent feature work will build upon this foundation.
- PNPM's `workspace:*` protocol is used to ensure dependencies always point to the local workspace packages.
- Follow-up work will involve integrating a task runner like Turborepo and setting up build/test pipelines.
