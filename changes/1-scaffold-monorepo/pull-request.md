## üåü User Story

> As a full-stack platform engineer,  
> I want to scaffold the foundational structure of all workspace packages with valid `package.json` files, source directories, and clearly declared interdependencies,  
> So that I can enable proper workspace linking via pnpm, enforce clear dependency flow, and prepare for integration with Turborepo.

## üöÄ Summary for AI & Human Reviewers

This pull request establishes the foundational monorepo structure for the entire platform. It creates seven distinct packages under PNPM workspaces, defines the dependency graph, and installs the necessary tooling.

**Update**: This PR also addresses initial review feedback by adding a root `README.md`, a `tsconfig.json` for consistent TypeScript settings, and an automated smoke test script.

## üß± Architectural Impact

**New Root Files:**
- `README.md`
- `tsconfig.json`

**Modified Packages:**
- `[x] platform-core`
- `[x] platform-ui`
- `[x] platform-app`
- `[x] platform-exec`
- `[x] platform-server`
- `[x] platform-dev`
- `[x] platform-db`

**Dependency Changes (per package):**
*   **`(root) package.json`**:
    *   Added: `test` script for smoke testing.
    *   Added: `ts-node@10.9.2` (dev)
    *   Added: `typescript@5.4.5` (dev)
*   **`platform-ui`**:
    *   Added: `platform-core@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-app`**:
    *   Added: `platform-ui@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-exec`**:
    *   Added: `platform-ui@workspace:*`
*   **`platform-server`**:
    *   Added: `platform-core@workspace:*`

## ‚úÖ Pre-flight Checklist for the AI Co-Pilot

- [x] **Dependencies**: All new dependencies have been added to the correct `package.json` files.
- [x] **Installation**: I have run `pnpm install` locally and it completes without errors.
- [x] **Build**: All modified packages build successfully (validated with `ts-node`).
- [x] **Linting & Formatting**: Code is free of linting errors and formatted correctly.
- [x] **Runtime**: The application runs without new console errors or warnings.
- [x] **Cross-Package Contracts**: Imports between packages are updated and contracts are respected.

## üß™ Automated & Manual Test Plan

**Automated Tests:**
*   **Command**: `pnpm test`
*   **Expected Outcome**: The script should execute the entry points for all primary packages sequentially without any errors, confirming that cross-package imports resolve correctly.

**Manual Validation Steps:**
1.  **Setup**: Run `pnpm install` in the root directory.
2.  **Action**: Run `pnpm run app` or any other package-specific script.
3.  **Observation**: The console should log messages from the package and its dependencies.

## üìù Implementation Notes for the Reviewer

- This PR establishes the core architecture. All subsequent feature work will build upon this foundation.
- PNPM's `workspace:*` protocol is used to ensure dependencies always point to the local workspace packages.
- The new `tsconfig.json` provides a baseline for all TypeScript projects in the monorepo.
